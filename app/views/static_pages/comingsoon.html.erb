<h1 class="page-header">JamesHooverDesign - Coming Soon!</h1>
<h4>Hey! You've stumbled upon my design portfolio. Welcome!</h4>

<h4>I am a software developer working in downtown Seattle. I love what I do but my true love lies in the visual arts. I deeply enjoy drawing, painting, photograhy, and design.</h4>

<h4>To chase this passion of the visual arts and incorporate it into the modern world I have decided to use technology as my medium. This has led me to 'user experience design,' a field that not only involves art and technology but also psychology and architecture, two other interests of mine.</h4>

<h4>My portfolio is currently under construction. I hope you will stop by in the future to see what I have created. Or better yet, send me a short email saying you found this page and I will be pleased to let you know when it's ready to be shown to the world.</h4>
